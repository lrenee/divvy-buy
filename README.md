# divvy-buy

## Overview

DIVVY BUY is a community sourcing discussion board application, which aims to provide 
a space for individuals located within the same community to come together to harness 
the buying power of a larger group / bulk purchase.

A few years ago I started cooking my way through a cookbook, beginning with the very 
first recipe.  Occasionally, I have found my progress stagnated by hard to find 
ingredients (such as Romanesco broccoli, Scotch bonnet peppers, and huckleberries, to 
name a few.)  In order to solve this problem, I decided to create an application that 
will help locate and spread the cost of such difficult to find items.  There is both 
a physical merchandise component (for example, the availability of huckleberries - 
they are limited to the Northwest, with Amazon.com selling a 3-gallon bucket), as well 
as an experiential component (for example, box seats to the Kentucky Derby).

Other examples include: Hanukkah cookies, mini Rubik's cubes (Alibaba.com), other box 
seats (such as to a concert or a playoff game), a premier wine tasting (such as a 
bottle of Dom Perignon and / or Chateau Margaux), and chartering a private jet.

This application should help to solve this issue.
